# Regressor Model to Predict Power Consumption
## Project Objective

**1. Perform EDA and FE and store the cleaned data to "MongoDB".**

**2. Build a Regressor Model that will be able to predict "Power Consumed by Individual Households"
using each of following Algorithms:**

    1.1) Linear Regression Algorithm

    1.2) Ridge Regression Algorithm

    1.3) Lasso Regression Algorithm

    1.4) Elastic Net Regression Algorithm

    1.5) SVR Algorithm

**3. Have to perform Hyperparameter tuning using "Grid search CV"**

**4. Evaluate the performance of the Model using MAE, RMSE, R2 and adjusted R2**
