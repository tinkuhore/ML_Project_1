Classification:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income



Data ingestion
Detail EDA
Preprocessing
Pickling for the preprocessing object(save the preprocessing model)refers to the logistic regression file which I have shared with you.
After preprocessing you have to store data inside MONGODB

You have to load the data from mongo db for model building in a separate ipynb file.
Now do model building with a given algorithm for the respective dataset.

Regression:linear regression,ridge regression,lasso regression,elastic net, support vector regression

Classification: logistic regression,SVM(kernels=RBF,Polynomial,sigmoid)

Hyperparameter tuning is mandatory(GRID SEARCH CV)

Evaluation of the model
Regression evaluation matrix: R2 and adjusted R2
Classification confusion matrix, ROC AUC score
